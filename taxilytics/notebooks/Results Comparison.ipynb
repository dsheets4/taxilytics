    "## Nano Cubes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contributions\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the contributions specified in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a novel data structure that improves on the current state of the art data cube technology to enable real-time exploratory visualization of multidimensional, spatiotemporal datasets;\n",
    "1. algorithms to query the nanocube and build linked and brushable visual encodings commonly found in visualization systems; and\n",
    "1. case studies highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of our technique, together with experiments to measure its utilization of space, time, and network bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data bound by display size (in support of visualization).\n",
    "    1. In reality, since the primary visualization is spatial-based (first dimension is spatial), the resolution of data is mapped to the map tile size.\n",
    "1. Supports any kind of summary that is algebraic with weighted sums and subtractions such as moment statistics.\n",
    "1. Links are shared across dimensions and within dimensions to save space.\n",
    "1. Support three dimension types in order:\n",
    "    1. spatial with potentially multiple levels of fidelity\n",
    "    2. categorical with possibly multiple, independent categories\n",
    "    3. temporal\n",
    "1. Temporal data is supported using summed area tables, which store cumulative counts progressing in time such that the count from one bin to a later bin (i.e. continuous time range) is the difference in bin values.  To find count only requires two binary searches, one to find the lower and upper bin, and a subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes (Limitations)\n",
    "1. The first dimension is always spatial\n",
    "1. The content of the last dimension is always a time-series.\n",
    "1. Returned data aligns to the minimal set of spatial labels that cover the query region. Therefore, returned results are from a spatial region either equal to or larger than the query region according to the spatial grid size.\n",
    "1. Results processing speed in nano-cubes are bound by the tree structure.\n",
    "1. Does not support arbitrarily shaped query regions (they claim it's possible, just more complex).  The queries now return more than the query region when the query region does not exactly overlap with their grid.\n",
    "1. Summed-area tables used for time-series are fast for lookups but are inherently limited.  They either take up a larger amout of space across the board and/or are limited to a sum that is less than or equal to the largest value storable in the data size used for the sum table.\n",
    "1. Timing and memory use is based on the cube storing count only (no algebraic or moment statistics).\n",
    "    1. Different measures are claimed as supported but it is apparent that is not the case without changing the time-series storage of measures technique. In turn, another structure supporting those other features likely increases memory consumption beyond a 'high-end laptop' RAM (defined as 16GB) as well as increasing time to query.\n",
